# Homebrew formula for the Solus CLI + self-hosted daemon.
#
# This file is the source of truth that lives in the main repo. It is copied to
# `Formula/solus-server.rb` in the tap repo (Ashton-Sidhu/homebrew-tap) by the release
# workflow's auto-bump job, which also rewrites `version` and the per-target
# `sha256` values. See packaging/homebrew/README.md.
#
# The formula pours the prebuilt, per-arch server tarball published to GitHub
# Releases by scripts/package-server.ts. It intentionally does NOT
# `depends_on "node"`: the tarball vendors a pinned Node runtime (bin/node), and
# native modules are NODE_MODULE_VERSION-pinned, so a brew node upgrade would
# break them.
